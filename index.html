        <h2>Kampong Cham province</h2>
        <h2>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
        <p>
          Kampong Cham (Khmer: កំពង់ចាម, UNGEGN: Kâmpóng Cham [kɑmpɔŋ caːm];
          lit. 'Cham Port') is a province of Cambodia located on the central
          lowlands of the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong
          Chhnang to the west, Kampong Thom and Kratié to the north, Tboung
          Khmum to the east, and Prey Veng and Kandal to the south. Kampong Cham
          was officially divided into two provinces on 31 December 2013 in what
          was seen by many as a political move by the ruling party.[2][3] All
          land west of the Mekong remained Kampong Cham while land east of the
          river became Tbong Khmum province. Prior to this division, Kampong
          Cham extended eastward to the international border with Vietnam, was
          the eleventh largest province in Cambodia, and with a population of
          1,680,694, was the most populous province in Cambodia. Its capital and
          largest city is Kampong Cham.

          Kampong Cham is the corrupted word of "Kampong Rong Chamm" means "The
          Waiting Port" then shorten as "Kampong Chamm", Later, the sound
          changed to "Kampong Cham" in Khmer. Kampong means port or harbor.
          Chamm refers to the "Waiting". A symbol the province is known for is
          two snakes sinuously wrapped around each other, which is located at
          the capital city bridge, Kampong Cham.

          Kampong Cham is subdivided into 9 districts and 1 municipality which
          in turn are subdivided into communes (khum) which are further divided
          into villages (phum).[5] The province formerly consisted of 16
          districts, however a request by Hun Sen's government to split the
          province in two was made after his ruling Cambodian People's Party
          (CPP) lost the province to the opposition in the July 2013
          elections.[3] The CPP won only eight of the available 18 National
          Assembly seats in Hun Sen's home province. The request, which was
          ostensibly made in order to improve administrative efficiency in the
          large province, was approved by King Sihamoni on 31 December 2013. The
          10 districts that remain in Kampong Cham province overwhelmingly voted
          for the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy,
          while five of the six districts cut out from Kampong Cham to form
          Tboung Khmum province were won solidly by the CPP.[2]
